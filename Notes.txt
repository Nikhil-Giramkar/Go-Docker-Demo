1. First I create a basic Go-App for hello world

2. Created a dockerfile, which helps in building container image, for our app
    in a dockerfile, we typically have 4 main points
    a. FROM - to indicate which version of SDK
    b. WORKDIR - to specify working directory, to copy the files into
    c. COPY command
    d. ENTRYPOINT - which specify that when a container is created from an image, what command it must execute
    e. RUN command -for creating exe

3. After completing dockerfile, its time to create an image from it.
    Before that, mak sure yoou are logged in to Docker
        docker login
         (Put your username and pass)
    
    Then run following command
        docker build . -t go-containerized:latest
        // This will give a name to our docker image as go-containerized

4. Once terminal processing over...
    Go to docker desktop and check the newly created image by us.

5. We can also check if the image is created via terminal
    docker image ls

6. Run the image to create a container - which runs the code
    docker run go-containerized:latest

    As soon as we run the above command, we see the output of our go app.
    Just like we see when we do - go run main.go
