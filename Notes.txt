1. First I create a basic Go-App for hello world

2. Created a dockerfile, which helps in building container image, for our app
    in a dockerfile, we typically have 4 main points
    a. FROM - to indicate which version of SDK
    b. WORKDIR - to specify working directory, to copy the files into
    c. COPY command
    d. ENTRYPOINT - which specify that when a container is created from an image, what command it must execute
    e. RUN command -for creating exe

3. After completing dockerfile, its time to create an image from it.
    Before that, mak sure yoou are logged in to Docker
        docker login
         (Put your username and pass)
    
    Then run following command
        docker build . -t go-containerized:latest
        // This will give a name to our docker image as go-containerized

4. Once terminal processing over...
    Go to docker desktop and check the newly created image by us.
